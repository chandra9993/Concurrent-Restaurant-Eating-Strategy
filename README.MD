Hi There,

This is the implementation of eating strategy for dinners to eat concurrently in concurrent restaurant.

Problem description:

This restaurant serves a special kind of dish that requires two forks to eat,
 no exceptions. A group of five friends go to Concurrent Restaurant for dinner
 and are seated at a circular table. When their food arrives, a fork is placed 
on the table between each friend and they are instructed to eat. Given that there
 are only five forks placed on the table and that each friend needs at least two forks to eat. 
The goal is to implement an “eating strategy” such that diners can eat concurrently.
